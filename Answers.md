        1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing will call for a whole new page when something like a link is clicked. It only sends the data that is needed to accomplish what it needs to. Also, SEO is really optomized for SSR because it has been the standard for so long.

Client-side routing is handled internally by JS that is loaded on the page. It requires all the app data to be downloaded on the front end but doesn't query the server every single time something happens. Also, the page won't refresh every time interaction (link clicking) occurs which makes navigation and interaction faster.
